        <p>Welcome to <strong>FL Music Help</strong>! This website is here to help people learn how FL Studio works and how you can create your own music with it. Not only that, but you can also discuss any tips you have to share or want to learn with others. Many DAWs exist, but I have the most experience with this one and I want to create a place for everyone to learn what I have.</p>
        <p>There are multiple different pages on this website, so here's what you can expect from each of them:</p>
            <h2>Pages</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt><em>Learn</em></dt>
                <dd>This is where the bulk of the information will be. Within this page are multiple subsections that will help you understand the different aspects of FL Studio.</dd>
                <dt><em>Discuss</em></dt>
                <dd>This is where you can share your thoughts, comments, and tips as well as learn from others.</dd>
                <dt><em><a href="links.html#links">Links</a></em></dt>
